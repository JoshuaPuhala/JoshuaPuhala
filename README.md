- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoshuaPuhala
- 👀 I’m a University of Arizona 🐻⬇️ student majoring in Computer Science. I am interested in pursuing a career in Cyber Security so I am always learning new skills including but not limited to: Python, JavaScript, Networking, Linux, Penetration Testing, Malware Analysis, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, JavaScript, Linux(Mint, Kali, Ubuntu Server, and hopefully remnux soon!), and starting to try out CTFs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything within my power.
- 💼 Most of my repos are going to be school projects or just clones relating to hobby interests. 
- 📫 How to reach me: jpuhala@arizona.edu
